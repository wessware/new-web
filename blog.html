                    <p> <strong>HELLO WOLRD SET KENYA!!</strong><br/>
                        Student Empowerment Team Kenya gifts ardent mentors a precious opportunity to uplift students with their own testimonies. There is a joy for the students being convinced that it can be done. The logic at play in this instance is the simple idea that there’s need to ease the struggle in doing what has been done before when there’s a better way one can pick from one that went through the same before. With honest heartfelt passion we unfold our tales to give hope and empowerment to the student.
                        Information is power and having learnt from our own experiences we are more than motivated to step out there and help our brothers and sisters make informed career choices. As images of those that ‘successfully’ found their way through the high school academic system. It’s a greatly humane task the vision bearers of this wonderful organization gifted us with; getting back to the community and help students achieve just like most of us were empowered to became who we are today.
                        Within me I bear the vision of seeing the organization’s mission completely come to realization. Fully aided by passionate mentors, associates, donors and other vital great stakeholders, the team greatly empowered to step out there and empower would be a dream come true. There’s a thirst for knowledge among the students and a passion to present it on the side of the mentors; ‘a perfect match!’ One can say. With this as the view point, seeing the mentors well equipped and facilitated would be great joy - a dream come true.
                        The team has its roots originating from Western Outreach (WESO) evangelistic team in JKUAT. It was actually founded by the ET members back then because they saw the need to reach out to and also impact students in schools. We’ve grown since then and are increasing our membership and also extending the opportunity to willing mentors. It’s my heart’s desire to behold a united team, bigger, greater doing exploits. Well, it’s a vision very possible.
                        Our principles firmly hinged onto God, we desire to not only step out and build the academic aspect of students but sweep through wholesomely through their social welfare and spiritual wellbeing. All these so as to shape successful students that can smoothly and efficiently fit into the society; a noble vision.
                        The empowerments we carry out, the enriching moments of true fellowship, the integrity at heart as we flip through the activities of each empowerment year makes this organization such a wonderful place to be. I’ve had awesome experiences giving back to the society through empowerment. For instance, the enriching impactful Busia mission I experienced under this great team in the empowerment year 2019.
                        The future ahead is bright, so for all that get this prestigious chance to take part, I’d encourage we work together wholeheartedly. It’s an awesome race to step out, help students win through their lives’ phases and calmly overcome the challenges they face. The vision entrusted unto us ‘the team of mentors’ is beautiful and noble, it’s my prayer that God will grant us grace to run this race. Together we set the pace.
