                                    The long-awaited Set Kenya magazine has successfully gone through production and we are happy to announce to you that it is almost ready. A digital final-copy of the magazine was submitted to the executive committee on Tuesday March 16, 2020 by the Wessware Technology lab for proofing and verification. Further on during the month will follow the printing of the magazine. 
                                    <br/> This huge milestone has been a collective effort of all the Set Kenya members, associates and other stakeholders of the organization. 
                                    We wish to utterly thank all those who contributed by writing and submitting their articles, on time. More applaud goes to the design team for the exemplary work and to the executive committee for their efficient coordination of events since the inception of this project in July 2019. 
                                    <br/> A member-friendly cost-per-copy will be arrived upon by the executive committee later on after ascertaining the total cost of production, and this information will be made available to members and contributors who wish to make purchases of the same. 
                                    <br/> Plans for the second edition are underway and more members are urged to come forth and contribute, keep checking with us for more information on this.
